 @abstract CHTRChatter objects represent a character with the basic ability to chat with other instances of this class or its subclasses.
 
 @discussion This class is supposed to be subclassed to implement a specific character or personality.
 
 It most importantly provides the nextMessage: and responseForMessage: methods. When overridden in a subclass, these methods should ideally generate a conversation that is as natural as possible.
 
 You can also provide an image representation of the character you strive to implement using the image property.

 @abstract Returns a chat message to be sent to the chat partner.

 @discussion This method is called to retrieve the next chat message for an ongoing conversation. It is supposed to read like a natural chat message the chat partner can respond to.
 
 You are encouraged to override this method in a subclass and even implement mechanics to provide a natural follow-up message in a given conversation.

 @abstract Returns an appropriate answer or reaction to any given chat message.

 To make sure the conversation reads naturally, you should at least take the message type into account when choosing a response.
